## __✍🏼Conclusion__

</div align="center">
 
<h4>
Creating this game was quite a challenge, I had several doubts when creating the code. It is a good way to start growing in the programming area, since you understand, analyze and imagine the problem to be solved, giving the best structure that can be.
For me it was a complex code because it was extensive and there were several conditions to be able to reach what was expected. I learned about new functions and techniques to work better and faster. I have noticed improvement in my progress due to the good practices with the teacher and the amazing explanations.
knowing that a game as common as the cat, has so much intelligence when it comes to coding on a computer, is admirable, that such simple things can become amazing.
