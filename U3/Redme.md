Game explanation
 
✅ This game will be human against human
 
✅ You must enter an integer number (those that are shown inside the board so that the move is correct)
 
✅ When starting the game
 
    🔸 will ask for the name of each one, putting the number of each player and the color
 
✅ Each player must give his best play
 
✅ The figures that the players will have are:
 
   🔸 player one will get >❌<
 
   🔸 Player two will get >🟢<

## _Steps_
<h3> Evidence explanation</h3>             
🔸 As a first test when executing the program, it is observed that the input (program) is shown on the screen, where it asks for the names of the players
 
🔸 Later the names of each player are placed assigning the color of the character and name 
 
🔸 At point 4 the victory of player 2 is shown = X
 
🔸 At point 5 the tie is shown, no victory was obtained
 
🔸 At point 6 the victory of player 1 is shown = O

## __✍🏼Conclusion__

</div align="center">
 
<h4>
Creating this game was quite a challenge, I had several doubts when creating the code. It is a good way to start growing in the programming area, since you understand, analyze and imagine the problem to be solved, giving the best structure that can be.
For me it was a complex code because it was extensive and there were several conditions to be able to reach what was expected. I learned about new functions and techniques to work better and faster. I have noticed improvement in my progress due to the good practices with the teacher and the amazing explanations.
knowing that a game as common as the cat, has so much intelligence when it comes to coding on a computer, is admirable, that such simple things can become amazing.
