# INTRODUCTIONS  

# HOW TO PLAY (WINDOWS)  
1. Download the DEV C++ app for Windows  
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/  
2. Then download the game code, you can get it from the "CODE BATTLE SHIP" index.  
3. When entering the code it tells you "Press to start the game", then a menu appears which gives you the options to play against an opponent or against the CP.
4. May the best man win and have fun  &#128512;

 
_Objective of the game_  &#9728;  
1. Sink your opponent's ships, before he finishes yours
2. Each player has a board (with 10 rows and 10 columns).  
   _Note: Your board is the "position board" and your opponent's is the "main board."_
3. Before starting the gThe player who sinks all the ships wins and there is no tie here your opponent's ships with movements (shots).

# CONCLUSION   
Finally, the objective of the realization of this game was to put into practice the learning that we obtained in class, such as: the functions and structures of the cycles, for, while, do while, if. We also saw other functions that served to give it a better presentation, color to the board, animations, in the end the frontend and backend code were combined. A flowchart was developed to have a better explanation about the development of the game.
It was not easy since we had to give him intelligence.
